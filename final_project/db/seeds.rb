# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# User.create!(full_name:  "Fake User",
#              email: "fakeuser@railstutorial.org",
#              password:              "password",
#              password_confirmation: "password" )
#
# 99.times do |n|
#   full_name = Faker::Name.name
#   email = Faker::Internet.email
#   password = "password"
#   User.create!(full_name:  full_name,
#                email: email,
#                password:              password,
